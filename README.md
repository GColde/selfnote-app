# Build

1. **Run the Build Command**

    Use the following command to create an optimized production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build

    This will generate a dist directory containing the production-ready files.


2. **Serve the Production Build**

    You can preview the production build locally using a static server. For example, using vite preview:

    ```bash
    npm run preview

    This will start a local server and open the production build in your default browser.

    By following these steps, you should be able to set up, develop, and build your Vite
    application successfully. For any issues or further customization, refer to
    the official Vite documentation or the documentation provided within your project's repository.
